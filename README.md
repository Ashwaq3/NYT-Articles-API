## Quick Start

Here is some guide on how to get and run the code, how to run the unit tests and how to generate coverage report in Android Studio. I'm assuming you have previous experience on it.

### Clone and Run the App

1. Clone the repository: go to File-> New-> Project from version control and paste repository url in the URL textfield 
2. Either run it on the emulator or plug in your android device and hit the green tringle button to run the app.

### Run Test Files 

You can do this in two ways:

1. Run it from the same file "Test only one file":
Go to the test file and hit the green tringle in the left side of the main to run all the tests inside the file or click the tringle next to one test to run that specific test only.

2. Create teat configuration "Run all rest files":
- Go to tab Run-> Edit Configuration-> + button-> Flutter Test-> name it anything relevant the select "All in directory" for test scope and your test folder for test file.
- You will find two dropdown menu below the tabs, press the second one and select the configuration you just created. After that hit the green tringle button to run al the tests.


### Generate Coverage Report

1. Go to File-> Settings-> Plugin-> then install Flutter Enhancement Suite 
2. You will see "Protected run" icon next to the debug icon just click it on your test configuration 
3. Now your files and folders in the project directory will have a percentage of coverage
